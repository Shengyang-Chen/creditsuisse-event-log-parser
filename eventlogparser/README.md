
### Assessment Project
This assessment is a maven-based project for parsing required event log and writing events to HSQLDB. The project is created using Eclipse with all the dependencies configured internally.
Key methods have been defined in Utils and DBManager classes, using the parallel streaming scheme available in Java 8 for handling large input files with suitable performance. 


### Starting the app and running tests
The project can be imported to Eclipse or any equivalent IDEs for execution, or directly executed from command line.

The project can be also executed as a JUnit test project, with basic unit test cases provided for the utility/DB-query methods.
